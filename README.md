# Vehicle-number-detection
Vehicle Number Plate Detection Using MATLAB: This project is an implementation of a Vehicle Number Plate Detection system in MATLAB by using image processing techniques to extract and recognize license plate characters from images.

Features Image Preprocessing: Grayscale conversion, thresholding, and noise removal.

Segmentation: Isolates the number plate and extracts individual characters.

Character Recognition: Matches the extracted characters with a pre-saved database.

Output: Saves the recognized number plate characters to a text file.

Requirements : MATLAB R2021a or later (older versions may also work). Image Processing Toolbox.

A pre-saved character database (imgfildata.mat) for recognition.

If the file does not exist, a temporary database is created automatically.
